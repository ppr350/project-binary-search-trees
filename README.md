## On Start Up
driver.js kicks in and run once it loads and does the following in that order:
- Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers
- Confirms that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced
- Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
- Unbalance the tree by adding several number > 100
- Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling isBalanced
- Balance the tree by calling rebalance
- Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced
