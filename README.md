## JavaScript Binary Search Trees
This is a project to create JavaScript Binary Search Tree. It has several useful methods to add data, traverse the tree, find data, re-organise the tree etc.

Full list of methods:
- buildTree
- insert
- delete
- find
- levelOrder
- inOrder
- preOrder
- postOrder
- height
- depth
- isBalanced
- rebalance
- prettyPrint

The Big O notation for Binary Search Trees O(log N).

## On Start Up
driver.js kicks in and run once it loads and does the following in that order:
- Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers
- Confirms that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced
- Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
- Unbalance the tree by adding several number > 100
- Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling isBalanced
- Balance the tree by calling rebalance
- Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced
- Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
